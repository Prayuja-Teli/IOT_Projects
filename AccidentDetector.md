### 1.1 Introduction<br/>

In critical situations like when accidents occur the person who had undergone the accident usually do not provided with immediate medical help, which may also lead to fatal. Now-a-days lots of accidents happen on highways due to increase in traffic and also due to rash driving of the drivers. And in many situations the family members or the ambulance and police authority is not informed in time. To overcome this, we create system, which is provide to vehicles.<br/> 

### 1.2 Problem Statement 

In critical situations like when accidents occur the person who had undergone the accident usually do not get the immediate medical help which may also lead to fatal. This might be because the message of the condition does not reach immediately to the respective hospitals in the nearby areas.<br/>

### 1.3 Objectives <br/>

help provider. When accident occur the heart beats of driver increases. And it is sensed by heart beat sensor which is mounted on or in steering of the vehicle. If heartbeat rate is greater the location of that vehicle is send to the relative persons. And we ask them for help.The purpose of the project is to find the vehicle where it is and locate the vehicle by means of sending a message using a system which is placed inside of vehicle system.Most of the times we may not be able to find accident location because we don’t know where accident will happen. In order to give treatment for injured people, first we need to know where the accident happened through location tracking and sending a message to your related one or to the emergency services. So in this work we are using the Arduino for cost effective and also for easy understanding. Here we used Heartbeat Sensor,assembly programming for better accuracy and GPS , GSM modules which helps to trace the vehicle anywhere on the globe. The exact location of the vehicle is sent to our remote devices (mobile phones) using GSM modem. <br/>

The Rapid growth of technology and infrastructure has made our lives easier. The advent of technology has also increased the traffic hazards and the road accidents take place frequently which causes huge loss of life and property because of the poor emergency facilities. Our project will provide an optimum solution to this draw back. A Heartbeat Sensor can be used in a Vehicle so that when accident detected it send the current location message to the relative numbers. With signals from a heartbeat sensor, a severe accident can be recognized. According to this project when a vehicle meets with an accident immediately Heartbeat sensor will detect the signal and sends it to Arduino controller. Arduino sends the alert message through the GSM MODEM including the location to relatives or a rescue team. So the relatives can immediately trace the location through the GPS MODEM, after receiving the information. Then after conforming, the location necessary action will be taken. <br/>
In critical situations like when accidents occur the person who had undergone the accident usually do not get the immediate medical help which may also lead to fatal. This might be because the message of the condition is not reached to the respective hospitals in the nearby areas in time. During 2008, Road Traffic Injuries ranked fourth among the leading causes of death in the world. Nearly 1.3million people die every year on the world’s roads and 20 to 50 million people suffer non-fatal injuries, with many sustaining a disability as a result of their injury. Road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death among young people aged 15-29 years and cost countries 1-3% of the gross domestic product (GDP).<br/>

### 1.4 Methodologies/Nature/Problem Solving Approach <br/>


increases, system track the location of the vehicle and sends it to the relative peoples. They will provide the help to them. The prototype model of an automatic vehicle accident detection and messaging using Heartbeat sensor, GSM and GPS modem using Arduino working will be made in the following steps: <br/>
Complete layout of the whole set up will be drawn in form of a block diagram. <br/>
A Heartbeat sensor will first sense the occurrence of an accident and give its output to the Arduino. <br/>
The GPS detects the latitude and longitudinal position of a vehicle. <br/>
The latitudes and longitude position of the vehicle is sent as message through the GSM. <br/>
The phone number is pre-saved in the EEPROM. <br/>

Whenever an accident has occurred the position is detected and a message has been sent to the pre-saved number. GSM – Global System for Mobile Communication.<br/>
  

GSM is used as a media which is used to control and monitor the transformer load from anywhere by sending a message. It has its own deterministic character. Thereby, here GSM is used to monitor and control the DC motor, Stepper motor, Temperature sensor and Solid State Relay by sending a message through GSM modem. Hence no need to waste time by manual operation and transportation. Hence it is considered as highly efficient communication through the mobile which will be useful in industrial controls, automobiles, and appliances which would be controlled from anywhere else. It is also highly economic and less expensive; hence GSM is preferred most for this mode of controlling. <br/>




  

GPS - Global Positioning System <br/>




  

GPS is used in vehicles for both tracking and navigation. Tracking systems enable a base station to keep track of the vehicles without the intervention of the driver where, as navigation system helps the driver to reach the destination. Whether navigation system or tracking system, the architecture is more or less similar. When an accident occurred in any place then GPS system tracks the position of the vehicle and sends the information to the particular person through GSM by alerting the person through SMS or by a call.
