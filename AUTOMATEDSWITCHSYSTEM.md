Today energy is related to electricity. And the ultimate goal is to save electricity.<br/>
Even if we switch off the appliances they actually go in standby mode and consume electricity, hence wastage of electricity is observerd.<br/>

1. Wastage of electricity<br/>
2. Switches are not turned off after the required use<br/>
3. Atlast , detoriation of enviornment<br/>


Automated switch.<br/>
It will turn off our regular switches when not in use.<br/>
Detectors and sensors will help to increase the automation of this device.<br/>
Automated switch will work on Arduino module for prototyping but afterwards we can use a microcontroller specially built for this purpose so that cost and size will be reduced. <br/>

A microcontroller board, contains on-board power supply, USB port to communicate with PC, and an Atmel microcontroller chip.<br/>
It simplify the process of creating any control system by providing the standard board that can be programmed and connected to the system without the need to any sophisticated PCB design and implementation.<br/>
It is an open source hardware, any one can get the details of its design and modify it or make his own one himself.<br/>
